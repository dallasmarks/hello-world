Resources for More Basic Practice
Before you begin your assessment, I wanted to point out some helpful links for practice (don't worry about being able to do these exercises, I just want you to be aware of the links so you can visit them later, since we still haven't discussed functions, you won't be able to utilize a lot of these resources yet!):
